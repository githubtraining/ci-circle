### Why did my CI build succeed?

The `.circleci/config.yml` file defines your build environment and tests. This important `config.yml` file defines the entire delivery process. Your CI build will succeed if:
- The `.circleci/config.yml` file is present
- Your commit passes the tests as outlined in the `config.yml` file

### Ensuring quality

Tests can be an important contributing factor to ensuring quality, but they're still only a piece of the puzzle. Integrations like CircleCI offer the most benefit with quality, high coverage tests.

No matter how well written your tests are, tests work best when paired with thorough review. Remember that all tests are most effective when paired with pull request reviews. To learn more about reviews on GitHub, take a look at the [Reviewing pull requests](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests) Learning Lab course.

## Step 4: Merge the configuration

Now that our CI build is succeeding, merge this pull request so the `.circleci/config.yml` file is present on the `master` branch.
