# Welcome

In this repository, we'll be diving into the world of Continuous Integration. **Continuous Integration**, or **CI**, can benefit your projects and change how you work on GitHub. If you're new to Continuous Integration, you may be thinking, "What exactly is it, and do I need it in my project?"

## What is CI? Why should you care?

[CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) can help you stick to your team’s quality standards by running tests and reporting the results on GitHub. CI tools run builds and tests, triggered by commits. The results post back to GitHub in the pull request. This reduces context switching for developers, and improves consistency for testing. The goal is fewer bugs in production and faster feedback while developing.

There are several CI providers that integrate with GitHub. You can find some examples in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration). With so many options, you can pick the best tool for the job.

The following diagram shows the relative percentage of the top 10 CI tools used with GitHub.com.

Our analysis also shows that many repositories use more than one CI service. This allows individuals within teams to use their favorites, instead of feeling stuck on one option.

The tools that will work best for your project depend on many factors, including:

- Programming language and application architecture
- Operating system and browsers you plan to support
- Your team’s experience and skills
- Scaling capabilities and plans for growth
- Geographic distribution of dependent systems and the people who use them
- Packaging and delivery goals

## Step 1: Enable Continuous Integration

Ready to see how CI can fit into your workflow? Let's install CircleCI, and start our very first CI build!

> Note: When you integrate with other services, private repositories may have additional costs. You can change the publicity of your repository in the **Settings** on GitHub.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable CircleCI on this repository

1. Navigate to CircleCI's [sign in](https://circleci.com/signup/) page in a separate tab.
1. Sign in with GitHub and set up a build on CircleCI for this repository. You will need to select *Set Up Project* for this repository, and *Start building*. You can ignore the prompts to add a `config.yml` file, as I've already done this for you. 
    - You can find step by step instructions in [CircleCI's documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#setting-up-your-build-on-circleci).
