Maintaining a release-based workflow for your project doesn't have to be a tedious and convoluted process.

In this course, learn how releases are GitHub's way of packaging and providing software to your users based on a specific point in the history of your project. We'll walk you through creating a release branch that is built on the foundations of the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) while giving you the benefits of a release-based workflow.

After completing this couse, you will be able to:


- create a release on GitHub based on a Git tag
- build a project board within your repository to manage your release
- create and commit changes on a release branch
- resolve bugs made after a release
- automate and better document your release changes
